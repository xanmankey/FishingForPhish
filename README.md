# FishingForPhishData
## A quick Q&A
### Why does this repository exist?
A lot of the initial research data was originally located in the repository with the code, which made git operations annoying. PhishAI (the website) is still a work in progress, but by seperating the data temporarily (for the time being; I may either join this repository and use it for website data when the website is in production or just create a new repository), it makes it easier to work with and optimize the base code (which needs to get done).
### What about the references to the data in the original paper?
The original research paper was written referencing the initialResearch directory in the FishingForPhish repository. As such, I'm keeping the original directory, but migrating the files (images, css, html, ect) to this repository and adding a notice about the migration in the README for the github. Links in PyPi + documentation won't being updated until I figure out how I'm going to handle storing website data.
