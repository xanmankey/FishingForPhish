# FishingForPhishData
## A quick Q&A
### Why does this branch exist?
A lot of the initial research data was originally located in the main branch with the code, which made git operations annoying. PhishAI (the website) is still a work in progress, but by seperating the data temporarily (for the time being; I may either join this branch with the website data when the website is ready for production or just create a new repository), it makes it easier to work with and optimize the base code (which needs to get done).
### What about the references to the data in the original paper?
The original research paper was written referencing the initialResearch directory in the FishingForPhish repository. As such, I'm keeping the pdf of the paper in the original directory (which remains unchanged, as images were embedded in it), but migrating the files (images, css, html, ect) and markdown version of the paper to this repository and adding a notice about the migration in the README for the github. Links in PyPi + documentation won't being updated until I figure out how I'm going to handle storing website data.
