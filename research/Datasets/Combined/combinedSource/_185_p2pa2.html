African consumers can make payments to international merchants in over five African currencies through the KlashaCheckout; the merchant then receives their payout in G20 currencies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allows international merchants to scale into Africa seamlessly through our technology and, in turn, allows African consumers to access global goods and services frictionlessly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">What theories concerning women founders did you have at the back of your mind when starting your company, and did it affect you at the early stages?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was cognizant that women only received less than 1% of venture funding globally, but that wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind as I started my journey or as I pitched to VCs or angels. In fact, it wasn\u2019t something I thought about at all, probably because I was new to raising money and didn\u2019t fully grasp some of the biases that existed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve always been bullish about shipping products that created an impact during my career, so I knew if we had a strong enough product-market fit, we would get funded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">At what point did you begin looking for investors for your company?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right at the start, our first institutional check was from Techstars in Dubai six months after we started the company. They believed in the team, vision, mission and the opportunity of building streamlined cross-border commerce solutions for African consumers. The market opportunity was there; e-commerce is less than 10 years old in Africa, with a 3% penetration rate and a 27% personal consumption rate in Africa, the second-highest after Asia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">How did you handle your first &#8220;no,&#8221; and how has that changed recently, especially with your company raising more than a million dollars?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got nos right from the start and that was fine. I\u2019d get a no, ask why and affect their feedback if I agreed with it and it aligned with my vision for the company. Today, more VC firms are willing to speak with us, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee additional funding. Some still pass on investment or pass and invest at a later stage or in a different round, which has happened on a few occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">There are fewer than 50 women-led tech startups that have raised $1 million or more in Africa. Being one of about 15 last year, what challenges did you face when raising this much as a founder and CEO?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our round closed quite quickly last year, so I think the major challenge was ensuring I did thorough due diligence on each investor and chose funds or angels that could add value to the company and that I wanted to work with. Investors typically deploy large capital into financial-based companies. Because Africa is currently undergoing modernization and consumer spending and consumption are increasing, conversations with VCs were more streamlined than our previous rounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Given these biases, do you think more women would get investments if there were more women investors?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, only 2.8% of women are funded globally. A recent Boston Consulting Group study found that when women-led startups can acquire funding, they\u2019re more likely to be successful than their male counterparts, delivering significantly higher revenue\u2014 more than twice as much per dollar invested in the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284025\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284025\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2284025\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg 990w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?resize=300,206 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?resize=768,528 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?resize=680,467 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FEBCF0D2-3E03-40E9-A7BA-D94928282C39.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284025\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jessica Anuna, CEO, Klasha<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, VCs should seek to invest based on whether the company has strong unit economics, TAM and the whether the founding team has true domain expertise in what they\u2019re building.

What affected me starting out was that I felt there were very few people to talk to who were in similar shoes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are women in businesses and leadership positions but few female founders to compare notes with. I struggled with the fact that I didn\u2019t see faces like mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>At what point did you begin looking for investors for your company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had to go the unconventional route at the start regarding raising funds. I found it quite challenging to raise funds when I started out, mostly because I wasn\u2019t part of the tech ecosystem, so in order to start my business, I used all my savings and went to family and friends to raise the rest. That was what I used to build our MVP before raising from institutional investors in late 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">How did you handle your first &#8220;no,&#8221; and how has that changed recently, especially with your company raising more than a million dollars?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found it quite hard to hear the word no. I think it was very difficult for me not to take it personally, but of course, it was a learning opportunity for me. It also made me realize that investors may not understand your vision in some instances, but it also means they may not be the right investors for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">There are fewer than 50 women-led tech startups that have raised $1 million or more in Africa. Being one of about 15 last year, what challenges did you face when raising this much as a founder and CEO?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say the biggest challenge I faced was getting a lead investor on board, especially because insurtech wasn\u2019t seen as exciting as it is now. Getting that first big investor to really believe and back us took time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>We all know that the startup world, locally and globally, is a male-dominated one and when it comes to raising money, there tends to be some bias. Can you narrate some of the biases you encountered during this raise cycle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main issue is the biases in the process and particularly around what investors or even who investors are used to seeing in front of them. I think the biggest challenge is knowing whether or not you\u2019re getting a good deal and what that compares to your male counterparts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also found that the traction discussion was always quite interesting in the fundraising process. I think there are big biases in this in particular because what is the right level of traction and how is that determined? The ambiguity around these questions really does open up the door for biases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your opinion on the disparity in funding between women founders and their male counterparts? And g<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">iven these biases, do you think more women would get investments if there were more women investors?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the issues we have is that some of the sectors investors are most excited about generally attract fewer women like fintech, insurtech, logistics. Due to that, I think we end up seeing fewer female-led businesses funded as the majority may be in sectors that are still new to investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284028\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284028\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2284028\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg 1008w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jihan Abass, CEO, Lami<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that having more female investors, more female IC members, board members will eventually lead to more investments in female-led businesses. My lead investor Accion has lots of female-led startups in their portfolio and I do believe that this is driven by the team they have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Most VC firms are required to deliver returns on their investments. Some argue that investing in startups led by men will guarantee such returns, citing examples to back up that claim. Given a few instances of women-led companies doing such in Africa, how have you convinced investors that your business can achieve this?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Coming from Africa is an advantage and has played a big part in our success. I saw many of these challenges growing up, so I have a deeper understanding of how society operates and how people view things. This perspective provides an edge when building solutions for the continent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our achievements have been consistent and making sure the VCs can see this growth we have made so far builds on trust and understanding of the potential growth Lami contains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fundamentally believe that it is impossible for investors to expect big returns from businesses they never funded. If female-led companies were given the same levels of investments, I do believe we\u2019d have more unicorns not just in Africa but worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The power of one\u2019s network cannot be overemphasized in the business world. How were you able to utilize yours when it came to securing funding?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My network in the tech space was quite limited. But I had a few great friends who introduced me to investors in their network. Our lead investor contacted us after hearing me speak on a panel at a virtual event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>In the VC space, it is said that those who hold the money tend to invest more in people who look like them. That\u2019s why women founders are encouraged to transition into angel or VC investing to increase the number of women-led startups that get investments. Do you see yourself making this transition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what I can accomplish at this level as a founder is to hire more women within our organization to encourage participation in such a field. For example, hiring top female talent because I think ultimately, you\u2019re empowering them to see that it\u2019s not impossible to build a fintech business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, they may potentially be able to go and start their own business. Being able to set up that kind of culture, hiring more women and empowering them could be an easier way to impact the transition of more women in fintech. I hope that one day I\u2019ll be on the other side of the table and provide support as an investor because I do believe that is the best way to transform the landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8eNgCIsMDN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa\/\">Kenya&#8217;s Lami raises $1.8M to scale API insurance platform across Africa<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kenya&#8217;s Lami raises $1.8M to scale API insurance platform across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa\/embed\/#?secret=noDvbI5o1W#?secret=8eNgCIsMDN\" data-secret=\"8eNgCIsMDN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Honey Ogundeyi, CEO, Edukoya<\/h2>\n<p><b>Please tell us what your company does.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/edukoya.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edukoya <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is an education technology company on a mission to make high-quality education more engaging, personalized, and accessible for the next generation of Africans.

It\u2019s up to you to have confidence in yourself and dictate your terms. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had one investor that tried to belittle my corporate experience saying it had no bearing in me being able to lead a company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another one went as far as dismissing my analysis on his sharky terms, even criticizing the expertise of my top-tier female investors that agreed with me. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unfortunate, but this is the reality of the male-dominated world we live in and these are the challenges women must be prepared to face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Given these biases, do you think more women would get investments if there were more women investors?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The short answer is a big yes, and that\u2019s why I am so excited by the likes of Serena Ventures, FirstCheck Africa, Ingressive Capital, Backstage Capital and so many more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of women, especially women of color, in decision-making positions such as partner or principal in funds plays a vital role in the gender funding disparity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also a need to educate our women to learn to leverage their network to create and structure their funds. It is a rather obscure world for the average Jane and democratizing it would do a lot of good for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Most VC firms are required to deliver returns on their investments. Some argue that investing in startups led by men will guarantee such returns, citing examples to back up that claim. Given a few instances of women-led companies doing such in Africa, how have you convinced investors that your business can achieve this?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, people that argue about past data when they are just imbalanced and filled with biases are not worth a second of my time. How can you make progress if you are only looking backwards?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, it\u2019s all about finding the people who believe in your vision. Our investors have already invested in emerging markets and know the growth opportunities related to these blue ocean markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also believe in our ability to execute, and the existing traction was already a telltale sign. Everything else doesn\u2019t matter to them. These are the kind of people I choose to surround myself with. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t need to convince all the investors on the planet. I just need a few aligned with my values and found them; everything else is noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The power of one\u2019s network cannot be overemphasized in the business world. How were you able to utilize yours when it came to securing funding?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing beats Twitter. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to DM a lot of female founders to share learnings. It was very easy to network that way and still is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one thing led to another. I told them about my business, kept them updated and as they saw the traction, they started introducing me to investors and people that knew investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of a sudden, I found myself raising money. Even investors themselves introduced me to other investors, which I didn\u2019t expect to happen. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, we are human beings, and relationships matter a lot. Business is built from connection and trust. Sending a cold email may or may not work, but an introduction is always better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>In the VC space, it is said that those who hold the money tend to invest more in people who look like them. That\u2019s why women founders are encouraged to transition into angel or VC investing to increase the number of women-led startups that get investments. Do you see yourself making this transition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am focused on my mission; nothing else matters at this point. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I have friends who are starting businesses and I am happily helping them by investing, so you could say in a way that I am already doing it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Fk4s6GwEl5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/07\/cameroons-ejara-raises-2m-to-offer-crypto-and-investment-services-in-francophone-africa\/\">Cameroon&#8217;s Ejara raises $2M to offer crypto and investment services in Francophone Africa<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

years now, dating back to the eldercare robotics\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/14\/intuition-robotics-6m\/\">crowdfunding campaign<\/a> way back in February 2017. Most of the coverage since then has found the Israeli company raising even more money <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/13\/intuition-robotics-raises-36m-for-its-empathetic-digital-companion\/\">across various rounds<\/a>, without actually answering the most important question: when? Specifically, when is the ElliQ robot going on sale?<\/p>\n<p>Seems the product is finally ready for prime time. What can I say, robots take a long time, and the company has spent several years beta testing. Intuition just announced that ElliQ is officially available today, through the product\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intuitionrobotics.com\/\">site<\/a>. As is the wont of the robotics industry in 2022, the device will be available through a subscription plan &#8212; RaaS, if you will. That starts with a $250 upfront fee and then runs $30 a month (if you go in for an annual subscription).<\/p>\n<p>Eldercare has long been a key robotics focus in Japan, but has had issues gaining a foothold elsewhere. Here in the States, a smattering of startups are getting on board, including Labrador Systems, while smart home device makers like Amazon and Google have begun building related functionality into their systems.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284260\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284264\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284264\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284264\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=768,511 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=680,452 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Intuition Robotics<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>I tend to think of ElliQ as something along the lines of the sadly discontinued Kuri or Jibo, focused specifically for an older audience. Rather than actually assisting with the chores like Labrador, it\u2019s designed to keep older adults engaged. The company says average users engage with the product 20 times a day for a combined 20 minutes or so. Meaning, it\u2019s not designed for the engagement level, of say, TV, but rather something more along the lines of frequent, brief check-ins.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter years of hard work this day has finally come,\u201d co-founder and CEO Dor Skuler said in a release. \u201cOver the course of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen the devastating effect that loneliness can have on the older adult population. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen ElliQ be incredibly helpful to our beta users and put a smile on their faces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a range of content available through the device, including workouts, health info from the Mayo Clinic, check-ins with loved ones and transportation through Uber Health, among other things. Effectively, assistance and engagement are the two things here for people who are independent enough to live on their own, but require a bit more help\/support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The astute TechCrunch reader will quickly note that we\u2019ve been covering Intuition Robotics for five years now, dating back to the eldercare robotics\u2019 crowdfunding campaign way back in February 2017.

raises $100M to build out its AI-based cyber insurance platform for SMBs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Cybercrime is on the rise, and today an insurance startup that&#8217;s built an artificial intelligence-based platform to help manage the risks from that is announcing a big round of funding to meet the opportunity. Cowbell Cyber, a full-stack insurance company that provides cyber insurance to SMEs, has closed a Series B of $100 million, which it will be using to continue investing in its data science and &#8220;risk engineering&#8221;, as well as underwriting tech, claims management, its reinsurance business Cowbell Re, and expanding its go-to-market channels.<\/p>\n<p>The company &#8212; based out of Pleasanton and active so far only in the U.S. market &#8212; is not disclosing its valuation, nor how many customers it has today, nor what its revenues look like at the moment. But Jack Kudale, the founder and CEO, tells me that it&#8217;s projecting its policy holder base to grow three-fold in the next 12 months to 35,000-40,000 customers (which would imply something around 17k-20k businesses currently) and that its premium run rate (the insurance industry&#8217;s revenue run rate equivalent) has grown 40x this year to $200 million, in what is still a very nascent market, with less than 10% of small businesses in the country currently taking out cyber insurance policies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that the first wave of cyber insurance growth was high but constrained,&#8221; he said, but he believes that wider themes in the market have changed the game both for potential customers, and for companies like his. &#8220;The threat landscape has evolved dramatically. Covid-19 expanded the attack surface and [even] the Russian invasion of Ukraine has expanded that great deal.&#8221; That, he said, is because the heightened efforts to introduce more hacking and malware around that conflict essentially puts more malicious tools into the market, not to mention more active participants looking for opportunities.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284516\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>On top of all this is the age-old issue with small and medium businesses. They are largely overlooked in comparison to larger enterprises, so anyone looking to build solutions specifically catering to them will have a lot of opportunities. &#8220;Underwriting cyber insurance for SMEs is a more dire prospect than for large enterprises,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s approach is fascinating, as it sits very much at the heart of big data analytics, the idea of &#8220;tech&#8221; in the category of &#8220;insuretech&#8221; and also taps into a bigger trend I&#8217;ve been noticing among insurance companies overall, where they appear just as focused on providing tools for prevention to mitigate risk as they are in snagging customers and getting them into regular premium payment cycles.<\/p>\n<p>Kudale tells me that the basis of Cowbell&#8217;s system is a massive data ingestion operation, where it monitors about 71% of the companies in the U.S. market, or 23 million businesses, to figure out larger trends in usage and SMB behavior, covering some 1,000 data points. This in turn goes into a wider algorithmic evaluation platform that he referred to as Cowbell Factors. Alongside this, it provides monitoring analysis of its individual customers to assess their individual risk profiles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These is continuous in nature, where you monitor both the business and the wider market,&#8221; he said. This is in contrast to other kinds of business insurance, which are typically based around industry risk guidelines published by third parties, combined with number of employees and revenue. &#8220;This is okay for any other kind of insurance but not for cyber risk. You have to assess each business in its uniqueness.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p4\">These details then are not just used to determine a company&#8217;s premium but also to give it guidance around its practices and policies and how to improve them. (This is not unlike how, say, life insurance companies now also focus on wellness; or even when home insurance providers give guidance on home security and charge users more when homeowners do not invest in better security systems.)<\/p>\n<p>Kudale acknowledges that this approach places the company closer to cybersecurity than insurance in some ways, although the company also sells through and collaborates with some 45 different cybersecurity vendors as well in its approach to the market. (This makes a lot of sense, when you consider how, for example, Apple will sell Apple Care alongside its hardware.) These sell the product alongside a channel network of 14,000 brokers. Cowbell does not intend to license its technology or white label its product to be sold through other business insurance providers, he added, believing that the opportunity for it lies in building out its own business on its own rails. He describes the company as insure-tech, cybersecurity provider, and actually financial services company rolled into one:<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We already offer security services at no cost, since we are already providing cybersecurity and insurance bundled together in one product. The better posture that our business customers have, the better they are to select and underwrite. But we are also a fintech because we have our own reinsurance operation [Cowbell Re] and take a small risk in that because it\u2019s been very profitable to us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One thing that it will continue to do is\u00a0<em>not\u00a0<\/em>move into providing services to consumers or larger businesses alongside its SMB focus. &#8220;The market is so big, and we don&#8217;t want to de-focus ourselves,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Cowbell forecasts that cyber insurance &#8220;in-force premiums&#8221; in the U.S. will total $100 billion by 2030 &#8212; a figure that will cover both large enterprises and SMBs, which is one reason that investors are interested.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cWith its unique approach to cyber risk underwriting and continued collaboration with cybersecurity suppliers, Cowbell Cyber has positioned itself as the leader in the cyber insurance space for SMEs,\u201d said Matthew Jones, managing director at Anthemis Group, in a statement. \u201cThe company has accomplished stellar results to date and we are thrilled to be a part of their next chapter. We look forward to the innovation they\u2019ll continue to bring to the cyber insurance market.\u201d Jones is joining the board with this round.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cybercrime is on the rise, and today an insurance startup that&#8217;s built an artificial intelligence-based platform to help manage the risks from that is announcing a big round of funding to meet the opportunity.

Labs sparks joy for utility companies by making their meters smarter"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Utility companies have a problem: Their &#8220;smart grids&#8221; were created to solve billing problems from a decade ago, not the needs and expectations from 2022 consumers with electric cars, solar panels and an obsession with real-time data. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copperlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copper Labs<\/a> just raised $5.5 million to help them solve that problem, with an elegant little hardware device that serves as a bridge between the low-resolution smart meters and the consumer&#8217;s internet connection.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem is even the most sophisticated electric Smart Grid deployments right now are only telling utilities what happened yesterday, and only in 15-minute intervals,&#8221; says Dan Forman, CEO at Copper Labs. &#8220;A lot of them are only getting that data once every 30 days. If you go beyond electricity into gas and water, most of those guys are still accessing data once every 30 days. The pace of disruption on the grid is not being matched by the pace of innovation. We&#8217;re helping utilities find more cost-effective ways to deliver the solutions they need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company raised $5.5 million led by <a href=\"https:\/\/cleanenergyventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clean Energy Ventures (CEV)<\/a>, a venture capital firm funding early-stage climate tech innovation, with follow-on participation from <a href=\"https:\/\/ngpartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Grid Partners<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bluebearcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blue Bear Capital<\/a>. With the new round of funding, Copper Labs plans to grow its sales, engineering and marketing teams over the next year to accelerate adoption nationally across utility territories. In addition to the funding, Copper Labs welcomes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nora-mead-brownell-3360387\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nora Mead Brownell<\/a>, Clean Energy Ventures venture partner and former FERC Commissioner, to its board of directors.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284200\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The Copper Labs team is on a mission to help utilities plan for a future with strained and limited resources all while recreating delivery systems fit for purpose,&#8221; said Brownell. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to support the team as they empower customers and partner with mature industries adapting to rapidly changing externalities for a more sustainable future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Copper Labs is essentially unlocking a trove of data the utility companies haven&#8217;t been able to access to date &#8212; especially important in a world where real-time data is a potential driver for behavioral change. It&#8217;s no good, for example, to tell a consumer that they were charging their Tesla during peak hours 11 days ago &#8212; at that point, the end-user can&#8217;t remember why they plugged their car in. At that point, the damage to their electrical bill &#8212; and the environment &#8212; is already done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Historically, on the residential side, demand management programs were primarily targeting connected smart thermostats, enabling [them] to reduce load during peak periods. That way, the utilities reduce the reliance on expensive and dirty gas <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peaking_power_plant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peaker plants<\/a>. The challenge with that is that connected smart thermostats are installed in less than 20% of U.S. homes, and maybe half of those individuals sign up for these control programs,&#8221; explains Forman. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t cover all the other problems that are coming down the line &#8212; EV chargers, for example. You need not only real-time grid edge intelligence, but a channel to engage targeted users. So for example, if we can see who&#8217;s charging an EV charger during peak hours, it is high-value information for a utility company. They can then target that individual with an incentive to curtail the load.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284297\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284297\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284297\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png 2748w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=150,66 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=300,131 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=768,335 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=680,297 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=1536,671 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=2048,894 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Copper Labs mobile app gives home owners an up-to-the-minute view of their power consumption and offers actionable insights and incentives to save power\/water\/gas. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Copper Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company has a few different solutions; an in-home bridge that connects existing smart meters to an internet connection, and a neighborhood-scale solution that can do the same for anything from dozens to thousands of homes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some Smart Grid meters have a ZigBee Home Area Network embedded. We can make a secure handshake and get that data back in about 30-second intervals instead of waiting until the next day. To install it, the utility would send a device in the mail. You&#8217;d install the Copper mobile app, and connect it all up,&#8221; explains Forman, holding up a laptop-charger-sized brick that plugs into a power socket. &#8220;You simply plug this thing into the wall, and everything it does is wireless.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The neighborhood solution does the same thing and needs its own internet connection, either wired or over existing wireless networks. It can be installed on a utility pole and service a larger number of homes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our neighborhood-level device will get about one-minute interval data from hundreds of homes from a single device,&#8221; says Forman. &#8220;T<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he value there is obviously a dramatic reduction in home hardware costs. No need to ask the consumer to do anything, and no need to rely on the consumer&#8217;s Wi-Fi because you&#8217;ve got a dedicated broadband or wireless network.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The cool thing is that Copper&#8217;s device can also track solar production meters, to show what electricity is being generated and delivered into the grid. The company claims that this is a unique view, especially powerful for the utility companies that don&#8217;t have visibility into the distributed rooftop solar arrays. The app also enables anomaly detection, usage data and additional insights.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With or without smart meters, Copper Labs opens up a high-frequency data trove for consumers, utilities and smart home providers to enable faster decision making,&#8221; said Dr. Carolin Funk, partner at Blue Bear Capital.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, then, the issue the company is solving is making legacy grids smarter than even the most cutting-edge of smart grids, bypassing the slower innovation cycles of the meter vendors. In addition, Copper&#8217;s solution is far cheaper, quicker and more environmentally conscious to install on a utility pole, than replacing a hundred perfectly fine and serviceable power meters at the home level.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EV8kfYNNDG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/14-climate-tech-investors-share-their-h1-2022-investment-strategies\/\">14 climate tech investors share their H1 2022 strategies<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;14 climate tech investors share their H1 2022 strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/14-climate-tech-investors-share-their-h1-2022-investment-strategies\/embed\/#?secret=znDVaLEHDQ#?secret=EV8kfYNNDG\" data-secret=\"EV8kfYNNDG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>If this sounds like something that the utility companies should have been able to solve themselves, you are correct &#8212; but it&#8217;s interesting to highlight the challenge of what is being solved here; the number of radios and wireless connections that need to be present for a solution like this to work is mind-boggling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing we&#8217;re focused on is solving really hard RF problems to where the same device can do electric, gas and water.

deep into Snorkel.AI&#8217;s pitch technique that raised $135m"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Storytelling is an art<\/span> as old as civilization, but it&#8217;s rarely taught anywhere despite the fact that the ability to tell a good story is instrumental to success in many, many fields.<\/p>\n<p>Fundraising is one area where good storytelling can be table stakes, but few founders know how to communicate clearly and succinctly how their idea solves a problem.<\/p>\n<p>Snorkel.AI&#8217;s co-founder, and CEO, Alex Ratner, honed his storytelling chops at a Stanford lab, and that ability, he said on a recent TechCrunch Live episode, was key to helping him raise\u00a0$135.3 million over four rounds since the company was founded in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was a pitch deck nerd even before giving a real pitch deck,&#8221; Ratner said. &#8220;I had it drilled into me on the academic side, that communication is everything. You could have the fanciest, highest-performing method. Still, it means nothing if you cannot communicate how it maps to real problems and how it is contextualized within alternative solutions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ratner was joined on TechCrunch Live by Saam Motamedi, Greylock partner and the lead investor in Snorkel.AI&#8217;s $3.3 million seed round.<\/p>\n<p>Listen to the episode, and it&#8217;s obvious Alex Ratner is good at telling his company&#8217;s story. Passion and savviness come through with ease, though when pressed, he admits he&#8217;s given this talk countless times \u2014 and that was the over-arching theme of this episode. Of course, it takes practice to pitch well.<\/p>\n<p>This episode is a must-watch for anyone preparing a pitch. Ratner and Motamedi drew a straight line from a pitch to raising early funds, and the starting point is a clear message.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2E5ZA9Ism6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=351&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think anyone can learn to be an exceptional storyteller,&#8221; Motamedi said, adding, &#8220;Alex has been a phenomenal storyteller from the time I met him. But, that said, I think his ability to tell this story has improved dramatically over the last few years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Motamedi points to Snorkel.AI&#8217;s pitch as an excellent example for entrepreneurs trying to improve their storytelling ability. It&#8217;s a critical balancing act between presenting a 30,000 ft. view of the market and the problem the company is solving that adds value to the customer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To be candid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the startup just needs to get this right.&#8221; It can directly lead to seed or Series A investment, along with convincing the investor the company has the right team in place. &#8220;These are the two things we look for at seed and Series A.&#8221;<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snorkel.AI&#8217;s co-founder,

umbrella brand for its digital experience solutions. These include, among other things, its data and analytics services, content management tools, a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/21\/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b\/\">commerce platform<\/a> and, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/09\/adobe-acquires-marketing-workflow-startup-workfront-for-1-5b\/\">2020 acquisition of Workfront<\/a>, a full marketing workflow management service, too. The Experience Cloud brand made its debut at the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/20\/adobe-unifies-digital-businesses-under-single-experience-cloud\/\">2017 Digital Marketing Summit<\/a>. This event is now the Adobe Summit &#8212; you can think of it as the Experience Cloud counterpart to the Creative Cloud-centric Adobe MAX conference &#8212; and it&#8217;s no surprise that the company is announcing a slew of new products and updates to its digital experience platform at this year&#8217;s conference in Las Vegas this week.<\/p>\n<p>The focus of today&#8217;s announcements is on providing new tools to help brands &#8212; and the developers that work for them &#8212; build more personalized experiences and provide deeper integrations between the different services inside the Experience Cloud, as well as some long-requested integrations with Adobe&#8217;s Creative Cloud, too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;The companies we work with are seeing that they need to deliver more personalized experiences to their customers &#8212; and they also need to really give their employees the tools to be able to be successful in this digital economy,&#8221; Loni Stark, Adobe&#8217;s VP of Strategy and Product, told me. &#8220;A big part of our focus in these innovations around content and commerce is to provide those capabilities to personalize the shopping and commerce experiences to allow for everyone in the organization that builds customer experiences to be able to get to the richest assets and insights they need in order to do that &#8212; and to recognize that while we provide some of the best technologies out there, that one our strengths is the ability to enable developers to build whatever they imagine, to help drive greater business growth and exciting experiences that we as consumers can all benefit from.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284376\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Maybe the highlight of today&#8217;s launch is the new <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.adobe.com\/app-builder\/\">Adobe App Builder<\/a> for Commerce, though. With this, Adobe provides developers with tools for building cloud-native content and commerce applications. The idea here is to help developers extend the capabilities of Adobe&#8217;s commerce solutions through a set of developer tools and SDKs. With this, developers can build both new user experiences as well as microservices to build integrations with the rest of a company&#8217;s IT stack. It complements the existing App Builder for Experience Manager platform, which launched at the <a href=\"https:\/\/experienceleague.adobe.com\/docs\/adobe-developers-live-events\/events\/2021\/oct2021\/introduction-app-builder.html?lang=en\">end of last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mkgpeWbHrjA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to have developers &#8212; when they approach Experience cloud &#8212; have so many different tools for building. They should have a unified experience across the API gateways,&#8221; Stark said. With the App Builder, she noted, developers can now more easily build more unique storefronts, for example, or extend existing e-commerce tools to also now offer in-store pick-up.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284413\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284413\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284413\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png 2664w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=768,386 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=680,342 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=1536,771 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=2048,1029 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/WFCCAEM.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Adobe<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As for integrations, Adobe Workfront, the company&#8217;s marketing workflow management service, is now connected with the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/business.adobe.com\/products\/journey-optimizer\/adobe-journey-optimizer.html\">Journey Optimizer<\/a>, which helps marketers manage and analyze their omnichannel campaigns. And as more employees within a business now take an active role in building these campaigns and experiences, the company also now build a deeper connection to Creative Cloud to break down these silos and give more users access to content in a company&#8217;s Creative Cloud libraries inside of the Adobe Experience Manager Assets and Assets Essentials service.<\/p>\n<p>The idea here, Stark noted, is to build what the company calls &#8216;experience fragments.&#8217; These are basically the atomic units that make up a company&#8217;s content libraries that can then be repurposed across different channels to serve highly personalized content to users based on their own preferences and the platform they are using.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284412\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284412\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png\" alt=\"Experience Fragments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png 1436w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png?resize=150,58 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png?resize=300,116 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png?resize=768,297 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png?resize=680,263 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Experience-Fragments.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Adobe<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As part of this focus on personalization, Adobe also today announced new AI-driven product recommendations in Adobe Commerce that allows B2C and B2B brands to offer better recommendations based on customer behavior, product sales or popular trends.

Similarly, the company&#8217;s new Live Search feature, which is powered by Adobe&#8217;s Sensei AI platform, is helping consumer brand provide faster, more personalized and more relevant search results (maybe that&#8217;s something Amazon should try, too, given that its search results often trend towards the comically inept).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Experience Cloud is Adobe&#8217;s umbrella brand for its digital experience solutions.

But it&#8217;s one thing to track all of this data and plot it on a dashboard &#8212; it&#8217;s another to make it actionable.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284430\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png 2004w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=300,224 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=768,573 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=680,508 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=1536,1147 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AA-Panel.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284428\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>To help businesses better understand how even small changes can affect a customer&#8217;s overall journey across their various properties, Adobe today launched a new experimentation feature in Journey Analytics that allows them to test real-world scenarios and analyze their results. A company may want to see if a change in their mobile app reduces call center interactions, for example, or see if a change to their website leads to more downloads of their mobile app. It&#8217;s basically A\/B testing with a focus on the overall customer journey, with the additional benefit that businesses can then use this data to precisely personalize the user experience for individual users or larger segments of users.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is powered by machine learning models that make it easier to find these kinds of correlations across vast data sets. Adobe says this algorithm takes into account &#8220;historical data, comparable campaigns, ongoing benchmarks, and more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Often, we&#8217;re seeing now people starting in digital &#8212; where they may not have before &#8212; but they&#8217;re still engaging in multiple channels through multiple devices for a singular outcome,&#8221; Nate Smith, Director of Product Marketing for <span class=\"il\">Adobe<\/span> Analytics, told me. &#8220;Ultimately, this has driven up the priority of omni-channel analysis for a lot of brands with that focus on lifetime value and retention. What has been a problem is the way that that type of analysis is done.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Smith argues that the traditional approach, with a data pipeline into a data warehouse or data lake, with a SQL layer and a visualization tool on top, is too cumbersome in an environment where stakeholders need quick answers to questions that are often seemingly simple but hard to put into code.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;With Customer Journey Analytics, our customer journey analytics platform, we have a lot of purpose-built components that are powered by our Experience Platform, which has been a complete native build over the last several years for all of our acquisitions in the space to then tie into natively,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen a lot of other vendors make massive acquisitions to build out these marketing cloud portfolios and we&#8217;re the ones that have actually developed a platform to actually do that, because, at some point, you run out of duct tape and baling wire to make all this work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this custom platform that then allows the team to feed data into the new experimentation feature. As Smith noted, this also means that developers can work with any of their existing tools to build these tests, too.<\/p>\n<p>Adobe also build a new integration between Customer Journey Analytics&#8217; ability to discover customer segments and its <a href=\"https:\/\/business.adobe.com\/products\/real-time-customer-data-platform\/RTCDP.html\">Customer Data Platform<\/a> [CDP]. &#8220;You can actually share any audience that you discovered in Customer Journey Analytics to the CDP and then take action on that in any system,&#8221; Smith explained. &#8220;For us, this is a really exciting moment [&#8230;] to see not just insight discovery but insight activation, ultimately.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4ex4-qExFjs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Adobe today announced a number of new features for Customer Journey Analytics, its tool for tracking customers across platforms that is part of the company&#8217;s Experience Cloud portfolio.

DeepWell is a new startup from games and medical industry veterans that aims to study and formalize these effects, so in addition to medication and therapy, you might be prescribed a nightly Stardew Valley session.<\/p>\n<p>For some, the notion of using games as therapeutic techniques may seem slightly outlandish. Can fighting monsters and poring over character stats really affect your mental health? But for others, myself included, it&#8217;s obvious \u2014 after all, many of us quite consciously turned to games as ways to keep ourselves grounded when all that awaited us out of doors was disease and dread. An hour or two of minding the farm, blasting hellspawn, or questing with friends was an important part of our self-care routine.<\/p>\n<p>Studies bear this out in various ways: playing a game can offer simple distraction, sure, but it also allows for more complex behaviors to be tested out or experienced in a safe and controlled manner. There just isn&#8217;t an organized way to track and understand these benefits in a way that might be accessible as a form of actual health care. That&#8217;s what DeepWell is meant to be.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283167\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>I talked with Mike Wilson, co-founder of indie publisher powerhouse Devolver Games, and Ryan Douglas, who has studied and shipped numerous medical devices, about this endeavor of theirs. Wilson said he was (after attempting to retire) trying to figure out how his network and expertise in the gaming industry could be directed towards making things better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how the talk started, about digital interventions that might assist someone&#8230; just, how do we help people? Ryan started doing some real research, and the research kept coming back that games \u2014 not like apps or therapeutic experiments, just <em>games<\/em> \u2014 can be therapeutic,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8221; When we realized that so many games that are already out, and have been studied, are therapeutic on their own just by the very nature of their design, that&#8217;s when it got real.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Douglas was quick to point out that no one is suggesting that games are going to cure someone&#8217;s depression or anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely adjunctive therapy \u2014 we&#8217;re here to support the therapists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we were in a mental health emergency before the pandemic,&#8221; when something like 12 percent of people self-reported mental health issues. The number is now closer to 44 percent, he said, and not likely to go back down any time soon. Not only are there not enough therapists, but many people can&#8217;t afford the cost. Alternative and preventive therapies are crucial if we&#8217;re to mitigate the crisis and avoid a new one. For that to happen we need to consider all possible avenues \u2014 and gaming, as one of the most popular forms of leisure, should be a part of that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are some principles of therapy that are just really well done in games,&#8221; continued Douglas. &#8220;Like roleplay \u2014 gaming is wildly successful at that. Movement, biofeedback, simulation, recognition. You could gain agency or self actualization, or maybe just distraction \u2014 the overlap between CBT [cognitive behavioral therapy] and gaming is profound. We have the opportunity to take advantage of what games have already been doing, the way you make new thought pathways, and make those your preferred pathways.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In other words, what if therapy was as fun as Fortnite? As Wilson and Douglas began to look into this more seriously, they found the idea resonated with many people in both the gaming and medical industries. Already dozens of people in both have volunteered their time. &#8220;Devin, the lawyers have been working for free. That&#8217;s how I knew we were onto something,&#8221; said Wilson.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284283\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284283\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284283\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg\" alt=\"DeepWell cofounders Mike Wilson (left) and Ryan Douglas.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/DeepWell_Headshot_Wilson-Douglas.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DeepWell cofounders Mike Wilson (left) and Ryan Douglas.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The self-funded and still early stage DeepWell will act in two roles: as a certification and recommendation body, and as a game publisher itself.<\/p>\n<p>In the first role, it hopes to work with other developers and publishers to formalize the studies and effects from their games. For example, if a game like Animal Crossing were to be shown to help people with social anxiety or agoraphobia, that information shouldn&#8217;t be buried in a journal article \u2014 but it also wouldn&#8217;t really be Nintendo&#8217;s role to make that claim. Instead, DeepWell would vet and organize the information, offering a certification documenting the process.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to be careful about this, and quiet, because this is a bigger and more complex deal than a typical entertainment company \u2014 there&#8217;s a lot more to consider here both ethically and legally,&#8221; said Wilson.<\/p>\n<p>Exactly what the certification would be is still being worked out; it depends on how regulators want to define this, what therapeutic effect is achieved, and so on. The goal would be to have certification help effective games be classified as medical devices. There&#8217;s already plenty of software out there used for treating various conditions, but these titles or digital experiences tend to be purpose-built for therapeutic use rather than the effect being secondary to the entertainment value.<\/p>\n<p>Douglas said that the research quickly showed that many games already have therapeutic effects, but that software designed to have the same effect tends to lack game-like qualities that make people want to engage with them. &#8220;These need to be great games first, and lean enough that we can actually sell them as video games.&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The second role is where DeepWell aims to bridge that gap. Like Devolver, they&#8217;ll work with independent game studios, but instead of trying to find the next big indie hit, they&#8217;ll look for games that produce the kind of effect they&#8217;re looking for. Though the company&#8217;s first game is too early in development to discuss in detail, Wilson said that the idea is to identify what&#8217;s therapeutic about ordinary games and double down on that without compromising playability.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As designers, we know how to get the attention, we know how to hold the attention; and where we&#8217;re headed is, we&#8217;ll be able to turn what was what we would call a sustained experience into sustained therapy,&#8221; said Lorne Lanning, creator of the Oddworld series and one of many creators who have signed on as advisors and collaborators.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gz5HrrCMGc8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean &#8220;sunshine and rainbows,&#8221; added Douglas. &#8220;It might be someplace darker, but where you can feel agency. There&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t use a shooter, or horror, because that&#8217;s what people might connect to.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Just as some people seek fluffy rom-coms to escape their stress, while others pick gritty crime dramas, the content needs to be specific to the consumer \u2014 or patient, in this case.<\/p>\n<p>In a way DeepWell seems to be set to intensify and capitalize on a trend that&#8217;s existed for a long time but has never gained mainstream acceptance. Games are far more often demonized in media as violent, addictive, time-wasters than allowed to be an ordinary and potentially beneficial hobby, like knitting or a book club. Wilson and Douglas hope that DeepWell will be part of a new wave of understanding of the power of media in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about our company and what we do, but how we interact with media in general,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;Games are just the most engaging because you have to focus on them, and you get out of the story in your head. The tools we&#8217;re building are all in the service of the magic that these creators are already tuned into.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Media and games helped many of us maintain our mental health during the last couple years of dread, but it isn&#8217;t just pure escapism: studies suggest games in particular provide unique therapeutic benefits.

raises $100M to build out its AI-based cyber insurance platform for SMBs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Cybercrime is on the rise, and today an insurance startup that&#8217;s built an artificial intelligence-based platform to help manage the risks from that is announcing a big round of funding to meet the opportunity. Cowbell Cyber, a full-stack insurance company that provides cyber insurance to SMEs, has closed a Series B of $100 million, which it will be using to continue investing in its data science and &#8220;risk engineering&#8221;, as well as underwriting tech, claims management, its reinsurance business Cowbell Re, and expanding its go-to-market channels.<\/p>\n<p>The company &#8212; based out of Pleasanton and active so far only in the U.S. market &#8212; is not disclosing its valuation, nor how many customers it has today, nor what its revenues look like at the moment. But Jack Kudale, the founder and CEO, tells me that it&#8217;s projecting its policy holder base to grow three-fold in the next 12 months to 35,000-40,000 customers (which would imply something around 17k-20k businesses currently) and that its premium run rate (the insurance industry&#8217;s revenue run rate equivalent) has grown 40x this year to $200 million, in what is still a very nascent market, with less than 10% of small businesses in the country currently taking out cyber insurance policies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that the first wave of cyber insurance growth was high but constrained,&#8221; he said, but he believes that wider themes in the market have changed the game both for potential customers, and for companies like his. &#8220;The threat landscape has evolved dramatically. Covid-19 expanded the attack surface and [even] the Russian invasion of Ukraine has expanded that great deal.&#8221; That, he said, is because the heightened efforts to introduce more hacking and malware around that conflict essentially puts more malicious tools into the market, not to mention more active participants looking for opportunities.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284516\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>On top of all this is the age-old issue with small and medium businesses. They are largely overlooked in comparison to larger enterprises, so anyone looking to build solutions specifically catering to them will have a lot of opportunities. &#8220;Underwriting cyber insurance for SMEs is a more dire prospect than for large enterprises,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s approach is fascinating, as it sits very much at the heart of big data analytics, the idea of &#8220;tech&#8221; in the category of &#8220;insuretech&#8221; and also taps into a bigger trend I&#8217;ve been noticing among insurance companies overall, where they appear just as focused on providing tools for prevention to mitigate risk as they are in snagging customers and getting them into regular premium payment cycles.<\/p>\n<p>Kudale tells me that the basis of Cowbell&#8217;s system is a massive data ingestion operation, where it monitors about 71% of the companies in the U.S. market, or 23 million businesses, to figure out larger trends in usage and SMB behavior, covering some 1,000 data points. This in turn goes into a wider algorithmic evaluation platform that he referred to as Cowbell Factors. Alongside this, it provides monitoring analysis of its individual customers to assess their individual risk profiles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These is continuous in nature, where you monitor both the business and the wider market,&#8221; he said. This is in contrast to other kinds of business insurance, which are typically based around industry risk guidelines published by third parties, combined with number of employees and revenue. &#8220;This is okay for any other kind of insurance but not for cyber risk. You have to assess each business in its uniqueness.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p4\">These details then are not just used to determine a company&#8217;s premium but also to give it guidance around its practices and policies and how to improve them. (This is not unlike how, say, life insurance companies now also focus on wellness; or even when home insurance providers give guidance on home security and charge users more when homeowners do not invest in better security systems.)<\/p>\n<p>Kudale acknowledges that this approach places the company closer to cybersecurity than insurance in some ways, although the company also sells through and collaborates with some 45 different cybersecurity vendors as well in its approach to the market. (This makes a lot of sense, when you consider how, for example, Apple will sell Apple Care alongside its hardware.) These sell the product alongside a channel network of 14,000 brokers. Cowbell does not intend to license its technology or white label its product to be sold through other business insurance providers, he added, believing that the opportunity for it lies in building out its own business on its own rails. He describes the company as insure-tech, cybersecurity provider, and actually financial services company rolled into one:<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We already offer security services at no cost, since we are already providing cybersecurity and insurance bundled together in one product. The better posture that our business customers have, the better they are to select and underwrite.

years now, dating back to the eldercare robotics\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/14\/intuition-robotics-6m\/\">crowdfunding campaign<\/a> way back in February 2017. Most of the coverage since then has found the Israeli company raising even more money <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/13\/intuition-robotics-raises-36m-for-its-empathetic-digital-companion\/\">across various rounds<\/a>, without actually answering the most important question: when? Specifically, when is the ElliQ robot going on sale?<\/p>\n<p>Seems the product is finally ready for prime time. What can I say, robots take a long time, and the company has spent several years beta testing. Intuition just announced that ElliQ is officially available today, through the product\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intuitionrobotics.com\/\">site<\/a>. As is the wont of the robotics industry in 2022, the device will be available through a subscription plan &#8212; RaaS, if you will. That starts with a $250 upfront fee and then runs $30 a month (if you go in for an annual subscription).<\/p>\n<p>Eldercare has long been a key robotics focus in Japan, but has had issues gaining a foothold elsewhere. Here in the States, a smattering of startups are getting on board, including Labrador Systems, while smart home device makers like Amazon and Google have begun building related functionality into their systems.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284260\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284264\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284264\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284264\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=768,511 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=680,452 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ElliQ7.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Intuition Robotics<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>I tend to think of ElliQ as something along the lines of the sadly discontinued Kuri or Jibo, focused specifically for an older audience. Rather than actually assisting with the chores like Labrador, it\u2019s designed to keep older adults engaged. The company says average users engage with the product 20 times a day for a combined 20 minutes or so. Meaning, it\u2019s not designed for the engagement level, of say, TV, but rather something more along the lines of frequent, brief check-ins.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter years of hard work this day has finally come,\u201d co-founder and CEO Dor Skuler said in a release. \u201cOver the course of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen the devastating effect that loneliness can have on the older adult population. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen ElliQ be incredibly helpful to our beta users and put a smile on their faces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a range of content available through the device, including workouts, health info from the Mayo Clinic, check-ins with loved ones and transportation through Uber Health, among other things. Effectively, assistance and engagement are the two things here for people who are independent enough to live on their own, but require a bit more help\/support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The astute TechCrunch reader will quickly note that we\u2019ve been covering Intuition Robotics for five years now, dating back to the eldercare robotics\u2019 crowdfunding campaign way back in February 2017.

Labs sparks joy for utility companies by making their meters smarter"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Utility companies have a problem: Their &#8220;smart grids&#8221; were created to solve billing problems from a decade ago, not the needs and expectations from 2022 consumers with electric cars, solar panels and an obsession with real-time data. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copperlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copper Labs<\/a> just raised $5.5 million to help them solve that problem, with an elegant little hardware device that serves as a bridge between the low-resolution smart meters and the consumer&#8217;s internet connection.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem is even the most sophisticated electric Smart Grid deployments right now are only telling utilities what happened yesterday, and only in 15-minute intervals,&#8221; says Dan Forman, CEO at Copper Labs. &#8220;A lot of them are only getting that data once every 30 days. If you go beyond electricity into gas and water, most of those guys are still accessing data once every 30 days. The pace of disruption on the grid is not being matched by the pace of innovation. We&#8217;re helping utilities find more cost-effective ways to deliver the solutions they need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company raised $5.5 million led by <a href=\"https:\/\/cleanenergyventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clean Energy Ventures (CEV)<\/a>, a venture capital firm funding early-stage climate tech innovation, with follow-on participation from <a href=\"https:\/\/ngpartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Grid Partners<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bluebearcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blue Bear Capital<\/a>. With the new round of funding, Copper Labs plans to grow its sales, engineering and marketing teams over the next year to accelerate adoption nationally across utility territories. In addition to the funding, Copper Labs welcomes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nora-mead-brownell-3360387\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nora Mead Brownell<\/a>, Clean Energy Ventures venture partner and former FERC Commissioner, to its board of directors.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284200\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The Copper Labs team is on a mission to help utilities plan for a future with strained and limited resources all while recreating delivery systems fit for purpose,&#8221; said Brownell. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to support the team as they empower customers and partner with mature industries adapting to rapidly changing externalities for a more sustainable future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Copper Labs is essentially unlocking a trove of data the utility companies haven&#8217;t been able to access to date &#8212; especially important in a world where real-time data is a potential driver for behavioral change. It&#8217;s no good, for example, to tell a consumer that they were charging their Tesla during peak hours 11 days ago &#8212; at that point, the end-user can&#8217;t remember why they plugged their car in. At that point, the damage to their electrical bill &#8212; and the environment &#8212; is already done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Historically, on the residential side, demand management programs were primarily targeting connected smart thermostats, enabling [them] to reduce load during peak periods. That way, the utilities reduce the reliance on expensive and dirty gas <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peaking_power_plant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peaker plants<\/a>. The challenge with that is that connected smart thermostats are installed in less than 20% of U.S. homes, and maybe half of those individuals sign up for these control programs,&#8221; explains Forman. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t cover all the other problems that are coming down the line &#8212; EV chargers, for example. You need not only real-time grid edge intelligence, but a channel to engage targeted users. So for example, if we can see who&#8217;s charging an EV charger during peak hours, it is high-value information for a utility company. They can then target that individual with an incentive to curtail the load.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284297\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284297\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2284297\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png 2748w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=150,66 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=300,131 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=768,335 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=680,297 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=1536,671 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=2048,894 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Copper-Labs-Mobile-App-Screenshots.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Copper Labs mobile app gives home owners an up-to-the-minute view of their power consumption and offers actionable insights and incentives to save power\/water\/gas. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Copper Labs<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company has a few different solutions; an in-home bridge that connects existing smart meters to an internet connection, and a neighborhood-scale solution that can do the same for anything from dozens to thousands of homes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some Smart Grid meters have a ZigBee Home Area Network embedded. We can make a secure handshake and get that data back in about 30-second intervals instead of waiting until the next day. To install it, the utility would send a device in the mail. You&#8217;d install the Copper mobile app, and connect it all up,&#8221; explains Forman, holding up a laptop-charger-sized brick that plugs into a power socket. &#8220;You simply plug this thing into the wall, and everything it does is wireless.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The neighborhood solution does the same thing and needs its own internet connection, either wired or over existing wireless networks. It can be installed on a utility pole and service a larger number of homes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our neighborhood-level device will get about one-minute interval data from hundreds of homes from a single device,&#8221; says Forman. &#8220;T<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he value there is obviously a dramatic reduction in home hardware costs. No need to ask the consumer to do anything, and no need to rely on the consumer&#8217;s Wi-Fi because you&#8217;ve got a dedicated broadband or wireless network.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The cool thing is that Copper&#8217;s device can also track solar production meters, to show what electricity is being generated and delivered into the grid. The company claims that this is a unique view, especially powerful for the utility companies that don&#8217;t have visibility into the distributed rooftop solar arrays. The app also enables anomaly detection, usage data and additional insights.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With or without smart meters, Copper Labs opens up a high-frequency data trove for consumers, utilities and smart home providers to enable faster decision making,&#8221; said Dr. Carolin Funk, partner at Blue Bear Capital.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, then, the issue the company is solving is making legacy grids smarter than even the most cutting-edge of smart grids, bypassing the slower innovation cycles of the meter vendors. In addition, Copper&#8217;s solution is far cheaper, quicker and more environmentally conscious to install on a utility pole, than replacing a hundred perfectly fine and serviceable power meters at the home level.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EV8kfYNNDG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/14-climate-tech-investors-share-their-h1-2022-investment-strategies\/\">14 climate tech investors share their H1 2022 strategies<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;14 climate tech investors share their H1 2022 strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/14-climate-tech-investors-share-their-h1-2022-investment-strategies\/embed\/#?secret=znDVaLEHDQ#?secret=EV8kfYNNDG\" data-secret=\"EV8kfYNNDG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>If this sounds like something that the utility companies should have been able to solve themselves, you are correct &#8212; but it&#8217;s interesting to highlight the challenge of what is being solved here; the number of radios and wireless connections that need to be present for a solution like this to work is mind-boggling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing we&#8217;re focused on is solving really hard RF problems to where the same device can do electric, gas and water.

href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/500-millions-deuros-pour-cr%C3%A9er-3-emplois-et-renforcer-niox-chateau\/\">announced<\/a> that is has raised a new funding round. With this round, the company has reached a valuation of \u20ac5.8 billion, or $6.4 billion at today\u2019s exchange rate. That makes Doctolib the highest valued French startup.<\/p>\n<p>The startup says it has raised $549 million (\u20ac500 million) in both equity and debt. Eurazeo is leading the round, with Bpifrance and General Atlantic also participating in the round \u2014\u00a0they already invested in the company&#8217;s previous rounds.<\/p>\n<p>In case you\u2019re not familiar with Doctolib, the company\u2019s main product is a software-as-a-service platform for doctors and medical workers. The company wants to help them tackle admin tasks. In particular, Doctolib acts as a booking platform that connects doctors with patients; 60 million people have used it in France, Germany and Italy.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284514\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>With today\u2019s funding round, the company plans to grow from 2,500 employees to 6,000 employees over the next five years. Doctolib relies on a vast network of offices in major and mid-sized European cities so that they can talk with doctors all around France, Germany and Italy. Doctolib plans to operate across 30 cities.<\/p>\n<p>In January, Doctolib talked about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers\/\">its roadmap<\/a> for 2022 and beyond. The company plans to create a suite of products and expand beyond appointment booking.<\/p>\n<p>And the company has already added some new SaaS products, just like Salesforce is always iterating on its suite of products. In addition to a telehealth add-on, the startup has a product called <a href=\"https:\/\/info.doctolib.fr\/doctolib-medecin\/\">Doctolib M\u00e9decin<\/a> that can help you centralize documents, see a patient\u2019s history, take notes and issue invoices.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/info.doctolib.fr\/doctolib-team\/\">Doctolib Team<\/a>, the company is creating an instant messaging service for health professionals. They could use the service to securely talk about patients and send documents.<\/p>\n<p>As Doctolib operates in a highly sensitive industry, the company has also been investing in security and privacy. Doctolib acquired Tanker, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/\">I first reported<\/a>. Tanker is a turnkey solution that helps you enable end-to-end encryption in a medical application.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, 300,000 healthcare workers are using Doctolib \u2014 not all of them pay for a monthly subscription. The startup also works with 250 public hospitals. And if you\u2019re living in France, you know that Doctolib has become ubiquitous.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PdgeN5enu9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/\">Healthcare tech platform Doctolib acquires encryption startup Tanker<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Healthcare tech platform Doctolib acquires encryption startup Tanker&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/embed\/#?secret=wa9wNPWAVN#?secret=PdgeN5enu9\" data-secret=\"PdgeN5enu9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"edXwIkzxvL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers\/\">Doctolib is now used by 300,000 doctors and medical workers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Doctolib is now used by 300,000 doctors and medical workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers\/embed\/#?secret=YTbQQyl72t#?secret=edXwIkzxvL\" data-secret=\"edXwIkzxvL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Doctolib has announced that is has raised a new funding round.

raises $115M at a $1.1B valuation to help internal comms teams get their message across"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">The Covid-19 pandemic, with its by-product of social distancing to help reduce the spread of infection, led to many organizations working in a far more distributed way than they had in the past, and that put a big spotlight on how well companies collaborated and communicated &#8212; not just under the circumstances, but as part of their deeper culture. Today, one of the startups building communications tools that saw a big boost in business as a result of that trend is announcing a large round of funding, underscoring its success in filling that need. <a href=\"https:\/\/staffbase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Staffbase<\/a>, which helps internal teams craft, send out and measure the impact of their communications with their organizations, has raised $115 million in funding, a Series E that catapults the company&#8217;s valuation to $1.1 billion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">The funding comes on the heels of the company reaching 2,000 enterprise customers, covering some 13 million workers in all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">General Atlantic led the round with Insight Partners also participating (the pair respectively led and participated in the startup&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/intranet-startup-staffbase-raises-145m-in-growth-round-led-by-general-atlantic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous round a year ago<\/a>). Staffbase will be using the funding to continue building out more integrations and functionality across its product &#8212; with a specific focus on integrating Microsoft&#8217;s full 365 suite &#8212; as well as continue expanding its business overall from its base in <span class=\"s1\">Chemnitz, Germany.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284506\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>There are dozens of tools in the market today built in the name of workplace communication and collaboration &#8212; which itself has quickly become a huge and somewhat nebulous category in the area of enterprise IT. They include the likes of Slack and Teams for chatting or sharing files, Asana for project management, Zoom or Google Meet for video collaboration, Airtable for sharing and collaborating around spreadsheet style templates; dozens of apps aimed at frontline workers (one recent biggie on the fundraising front is Connecteam, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/connecteam-raises-120m-at-an-800m-valuation-for-its-all-in-one-communications-app-for-deskless-workers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised $120 million<\/a> earlier this month), and more.<\/p>\n<p>Staffbase sits both alongside but distinctly separate from these various tools. Martin B\u00f6hringer, its co-founder and CEO, tells me that part of its unique selling point lies in the fact that its primary customer target the internal communications team, which is not typically the primary focus for any of those other tools.<\/p>\n<p>Staffbase has built a platform for constructing and sending out communications, and measuring their impact, and in itself it offers a full suite of communications products &#8212; it provides an email app, tools to build and manage an intranet, and an employee app that workers can use to communicate with each other and hear announcements and more from management (this last one looks very similar to Workplace from Meta) &#8212; but it also provides a way for its users (the internal comms teams) also to integrate and leverage whatever tools an organization might already be using for any of these functions if their intention is not to reinvent the wheel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We integrate existing apps, or we can also provide a replacement for them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One thing that makes us stand out is that we are not a point solution.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Internal comms often gets the thin end of the attention wedge in the workplace: you may be head-down working on whatever project you need to complete, or goal you need to meet, by a certain deadline; or you may simply be busy with the immediate demands of your job. In any case, all those in themselves will come with a lot of communications noise and distraction. In that context, internal comms might often feel less urgent or immediate to what you need to do.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not the full story, of course, and that issue has become ever more acute in recent years as companies need to move into different modes of working, or have undergone huge transformation projects. Keeping in touch with staff becomes more critical, but the messages you are sending out might actually carry more information and weight than previously, too. All this has given a new imperative to internal comms teams to use better tools to reach people and approach their jobs with more focus, leveraging technology that other departments like marketing have used to measure impact and reach for example.<\/p>\n<p>B\u00f6hringer believes that &#8220;internal comms has become a business-critical area. If they can reach hearts and minds, they really can change behavior, and that is important in times of change or transformation, where you have hybrid teams, newer or younger employees, or if you are working with products that have had to completely evolve. Sometimes these need to be super-fast, significant shifts. And so teams are looking for solutions to elevate that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p23\">That shift also potentially opens the door to a wider set of use cases around what an internal comms team might develop, and how it might deliver that information to employees and other staff. Workplace training and education has yet to be an area that Staffbase has explored, B\u00f6hringer said, although it is an obvious evolution for the platform, given that gamification has long been seen as one way of engaging staff around new policies and news. For now the traction it has seen and the gap it&#8217;s filling in the market have helped it step into the big leagues of communications tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">\u201cStaffbase\u2019s significant growth demonstrates the global resonance of its mission to enable deeper engagement between enterprises and their employees. As the world continues to adapt to new modalities of working, and as enterprise workforces become increasingly international, connectivity and communication will become more valuable than ever before,&#8221; said Achim Berg, operating partner at General Atlantic, in a statement. &#8220;We are proud to back Martin and the Staffbase team as they develop solutions that have a positive impact on organizations worldwide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p10\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Covid-19 pandemic, with its by-product of social distancing to help reduce the spread of

The London startup currently has 400,000 paying subscribers who get all-you-can-read access to some 850,000 titles &#8212; textbooks, fiction and other literature that students are assigned as coursework at universities and other higher-learning institutions. That catalogue, the startup says, makes Perlego the largest online textbook subscription service in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Mediahuis Ventures, the VC arm of European media group Mediahuis, led the round with participation also from Raine Ventures, the VC arm of Raine Group (the investment bank that&#8217;s overseeing the sale of Chelsea FC), and Evli Growth Partners. This round, a Series B, also had angel investors, such as the two co-founders of Kahoot, Jamie Brooker and Johan Brand, by way of their We Are Human fund; as well as backing from &#8220;strategic&#8221; publishers.<\/p>\n<p>Perlego doesn&#8217;t disclose which strategics those might be from the long list of its current partners. Perlego (Latin for &#8220;I read&#8221;) works with 5,000 education publishers, including Cengage, Routledge, Cambridge University Press, Elsevier and Harvard University Press.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283865\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284493\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284493\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2284493\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg 1631w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=768,377 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=680,334 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=1536,753 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/perlego-team-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/perlego.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perlego <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Gauthier Van Malderen and Matthew Davis founded the company in 2017, when, as newly minted university grads, they were inspired to build a platform to address what they felt was an acute financial issue for students: the very high cost of textbooks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This was a pain point of mine,&#8221; Van Malderen said, recalling how he would typically pay \u00a3200-\u00a3300 for a single book, only to &#8220;read one assigned chapter and then never use it again.&#8221; It was not unlike how you might want to hear a few songs but not a full album by a recording artist. &#8220;So I thought, surely a subscription model would work here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The high cost of textbooks is something that many a student if higher learning will know all too well. A survey from the <a href=\"https:\/\/uspirg.org\/sites\/pirg\/files\/reports\/Fixing%20the%20Broken%20Textbook%20Market,%203e%20February%202021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Public Interest Research Group<\/a> in the U.S. found that in 2020 some 65% of college students reported that they held off from buying school textbooks because of the prices, despite knowing that it would likely impact how well they did in the courses. Van Malderen also cited a stat (but didn&#8217;t give me the source) that some 23% of students drop classes because of the cost of the books required to take them.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe market for educational content has lagged other types of content, which have successfully digitized and offered new models of consumption to users. We believe that adoption of an online subscription model in this category is inevitable, and that Perlego\u2019s platform and business model will lead the education industry in this digital shift,&#8221; said Elizabeth Brillman, VC partner at Raine Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Gauthier and the entire Perlego team in this journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Initially, he said, publishers were a little slower, but not uninterested, in engaging with the startup to see what might come of the relationship. As Van Malderen described it, while publishers have had a pretty firm grip on publishing books for a predictable market space &#8212; those in education &#8212; the situation had some significant cracks in it from their perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A big issue for publishers is that they price textbooks high in part to offset piracy,&#8221; he said. (And he didn&#8217;t add this, but the more limited publishing runs and specialized nature of the titles clearly also play a role.) But he added what hurts them more is <em>not<\/em> illegal but equally disruptive and something publishers were keen to combat: the second-hand book market. Those two forces have actually been on a collision course for some time. Perlego claims that in 2021, it intercepted 2.1 million searches online for &#8220;free&#8221; pirated textbooks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A model like ours not only prevents piracy, but it reduces the need for second-hand books,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the business model has been built around the idea of making the book subscription not free but at least considerably more affordable for students, or even institutions that might want to partner with Perlego to give their students access to the service as part of their offering to them. The company currently has a two-week free trial before users have to either pay monthly (\u00a312 in the U.K.; $18 in the U.S.) or annually (which works out to \u00a38; $12 per month). But it does not have a freemium tier a la Spotify as it&#8217;s still considering how that might look.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I am against ads,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to create a clean space without the stress of advertising. We are not keen to have advertising in the loop.&#8221; He said that potentially one idea might be to create tiers of books instead, where some are free to use, and others require premium subscriptions. In terms of publishers, it works on a revenue share model, where 65% of its subscription revenues are in turn distributed to publishers it works with, with an additional commission paid based on consumption of work and the value of the book. Over time, he said thety are also considering how they might work with publishers also to sell actual hard copies of books that people might like to own for life.<\/p>\n<p>As with other companies that have built businesses around e-books, Perlego isn&#8217;t just extolling the virtues of lower pricing, but also highlights (pun intended) the advantages of the digital interface for other reasons: Van Malderen says that the books become part of a &#8220;private digital library&#8221; that is more dynamic (and easier to carry around) than the analogue version, and where (in tech terms) that library becomes a kind of platform in itself: you have the ability to save your own annotations, and for people to share annotations with each other, as well as add other documents, and other kind of media, beyond Perlego books to those libraries.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vision is to be an ecosystem to find all your course material, including videos or PDFs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We believe that could also be a place for instructors to carry out your work assignments and grading, too, streamlining for everyone.&#8221; It is also not the only one looking at how to leverage digital platforms to disrupt the textbook industry. Chegg has also built out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chegg.com\/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rental\/purchasing portal<\/a> for online textbooks; <a href=\"https:\/\/openlibrary.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Library<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/human.libretexts.org\/Bookshelves\/History\/World_History\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Libre Texts<\/a> are two others; but none of these are as extensive in terms of catalogues and functionality as Perlego &#8212; not yet at least.<\/p>\n<p>The model is one that seems to be finding some interesting traction with the three sides of Perlego&#8217;s marketplace all growing especially in the last two years, at time when online learning has taken a hold of the world in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. It now has linked up with 6,000 institutions to fulfill class and course syllabi across 172 countries. Some 40% of the students that use Perlego are in the US. In 2021, Perlego saw 450% subscriber growth, and publishers have also warmed to it: its book catalogue has gone up 166% in the last year, and has grown by more than 500,000 since 2019, when it was at a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/perlego-raises-9m-series-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mere 300,000 titles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Perlego is changing the equation for university students, helping them access course resources, while also enabling publishers to move online and harness new revenue opportunities. We\u2019ve watched the company soar since our first investment, and are excited to double down on our commitment to the company in their Series B. Making independent information accessible to society is at the heart of what we do. Mediahuis is pleased to extend its mission further into higher education.&#8221; said Paul Verwilt, COO at Mediahuis, in a statement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spotify helped pave the way for a new model for consumers to listen to music: pay a monthly fee to stream whatever you want, with no need to own any physical or digital versions of it.

raises $50M for an operating system that helps retailers sell through marketplaces"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Marketplaces are the order of the day when it comes to selling online, providing a one-stop shop for shoppers, and for retailers looking to target as many would-be buyers as possible, while also creating more economies of scale in areas fulfillment and delivery. Amazon has become the name synonymous with marketplace selling, but it&#8217;s far from the only player in town. Today, a startup called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.channelengine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChannelEngine<\/a>, which helps retailers connect with and sell through more than 200 marketplaces, is announcing a growth round of funding to continue building out its business amid strong demand. The startup &#8212; based out of Leiden, Netherlands &#8212; has raised $50 million, funding that it will be using both to continue expanding the number of marketplaces it works with, the number of retailers that it connects to them, and to work on building out what the next generation of e-commerce will look like for all of them.<\/p>\n<p>Atomico is leading the round, with new investor\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">General Catalyst<\/span>, plus previous backers <span class=\"s1\">Inkef<\/span> and <span class=\"s1\">Airbridge Equity Partners<\/span>, also participating; along with Stephan Schambach, the founder of Demandware, Intershop and NewStore, coming on as an angel investor.<\/p>\n<p>Valuation is not being disclosed but as a marker of how the company has been growing at a profit up to now, it was founded in 2013 raised only around $7 million before this round, most recently doubling revenues in the last year on a base of over 450 retailer customers, with the list including the likes of Bugaboo, Staples, JBL, Polaroid, Hunkem\u00f6ller, Brabantia, Reckitt Benckiser, Bosch, JDE, Electrolux, Philips Domestic Appliances, Signify, Diadora, Glanbia, Oneill, and Safavieh. (It&#8217;s not disclosing revenues, or valuation, with this round.)<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284495\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The rise of ChannelEngine comes not just at a time when e-commerce has really come into its own &#8212; the pandemic drove many companies and people to selling and buying online &#8212; but specifically the rise of the marketplace as a key component of that online buying experience. Amazon has made a killing in the world of e-commerce by way of its Marketplace: aggregating millions of retailers in one place creates a one-stop shop for those looking for goods, and retailers can lean on Amazon&#8217;s economies of scale not only to sell to those shoppers, but to distribute and deliver those products, too.<\/p>\n<p>But Amazon is just the tip of the marketplace iceberg. eBay, Walmart, Zalando, Mercado Libre, AliExpress, Back Market, Shopee, Lazada, Mirakl, Bol.com, Allegro, CDON, Cdiscount, Catch are examples of the many other generalist and more localized storefronts out there for retailers to leverage when targeting consumers. Even Macy&#8217;s has moved into the marketplace model.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They are all becoming marketplaces,&#8221; said ChannelEngine founder and CEO Jorrit Steinz.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge up to now has been trying to set up relationships with each and every marketplace, and that is what ChannelEngine tackles with its platform, providing a set of tools that will help retailers adjust pricing based on the site and audience and what&#8217;s selling for what (automated repricing in the parlance of the trade); handle their content, stock and order management; and connect with third parties to handle further analytics and delivery.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company currently manages distribution for some\u00a06 million products from 8,100 brands across more than 200 sales channels.<\/p>\n<p>There have been other approaches in the world of e-commerce to help smaller retailers navigate growth amid the choppy waters of marketplaces. One of the most ubiquitous from a funding perspective at least has been the rise of Thrasio-style aggregators, e-commerce roll-up plays that promise better economies of scale to smaller brands by way of scooping them up and working with them as a more cohesive, scaled-up group to better leverage sales data, as well as manufacturing and distribution networks. Interestingly, Steinz tells me that a number of these are actually ChannelEngine&#8217;s customers: many promise to help their brands sell better on marketplaces, but in a lot of cases, their expertise is more in identifying the most successful retailers and helping them on specific marketplaces like Amazon, not actually working across multiple platforms: that is technology they often buy in, working with the likes ChannelEngine to fill out that business opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, that also potentially makes a company like ChannelEngine, combined with other tools like headless commerce builders and those that help companies design and run their own storefronts, an alternative to selling up to a bigger brand.<\/p>\n<p>Longer term, Steinz noted that other opportunities on the horizon will likely include not just more marketplaces but more non-commerce platforms for selling that become de-facto marketplaces, such as Instagram and TikTok, as they integrate more direct selling tools and better ways to discover what is being sold on their platforms beyond algorithmic inline ads. Altogether, the e-commerce market is being projected to reach $5.9 trillion by 2023.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, which now accounts for 20% of all global retail sales. The global e-commerce market is expected to grow by over $500 billion between 2022 and 2023 alone,\u201d said Atomico principal Luca Eisenstecken in a statement. \u201cBy building the largest e-commerce operating platform, ChannelEngine is set to capitalize on this opportunity by giving brands and retailers instant access to the global marketplace.\u201d She is joining the board with this round.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the use of e-commerce continues to accelerate, retailers and brands have to meet consumers where and how they shop.

African consumers can make payments to international merchants in over five African currencies through the KlashaCheckout; the merchant then receives their payout in G20 currencies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allows international merchants to scale into Africa seamlessly through our technology and, in turn, allows African consumers to access global goods and services frictionlessly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">What theories concerning women founders did you have at the back of your mind when starting your company, and did it affect you at the early stages?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was cognizant that women only received less than 1% of venture funding globally, but that wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind as I started my journey or as I pitched to VCs or angels. In fact, it wasn\u2019t something I thought about at all, probably because I was new to raising money and didn\u2019t fully grasp some of the biases that existed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve always been bullish about shipping products that created an impact during my career, so I knew if we had a strong enough product-market fit, we would get funded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">At what point did you begin looking for investors for your company?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right at the start, our first institutional check was from Techstars in Dubai six months after we started the company. They believed in the team, vision, mission and the opportunity of building streamlined cross-border commerce solutions for African consumers. The market opportunity was there; e-commerce is less than 10 years old in Africa, with a 3% penetration rate and a 27% personal consumption rate in Africa, the second-highest after Asia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">How did you handle your first &#8220;no,&#8221; and how has that changed recently, especially with your company raising more than a million dollars?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got nos right from the start and that was fine. I\u2019d get a no, ask why and affect their feedback if I agreed with it and it aligned with my vision for the company. Today, more VC firms are willing to speak with us, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee additional funding.

Investors typically deploy large capital into financial-based companies. Because Africa is currently undergoing modernization and consumer spending and consumption are increasing, conversations with VCs were more streamlined than our previous rounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Given these biases, do you think more women would get investments if there were more women investors?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, only 2.8% of women are funded globally.

Being one of about 15 last year, what challenges did you face when raising this much as a founder and CEO?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say the biggest challenge I faced was getting a lead investor on board, especially because insurtech wasn\u2019t seen as exciting as it is now. Getting that first big investor to really believe and back us took time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>We all know that the startup world, locally and globally, is a male-dominated one and when it comes to raising money, there tends to be some bias. Can you narrate some of the biases you encountered during this raise cycle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main issue is the biases in the process and particularly around what investors or even who investors are used to seeing in front of them. I think the biggest challenge is knowing whether or not you\u2019re getting a good deal and what that compares to your male counterparts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also found that the traction discussion was always quite interesting in the fundraising process. I think there are big biases in this in particular because what is the right level of traction and how is that determined? The ambiguity around these questions really does open up the door for biases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your opinion on the disparity in funding between women founders and their male counterparts? And g<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">iven these biases, do you think more women would get investments if there were more women investors?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the issues we have is that some of the sectors investors are most excited about generally attract fewer women like fintech, insurtech, logistics. Due to that, I think we end up seeing fewer female-led businesses funded as the majority may be in sectors that are still new to investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284028\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284028\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2284028\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg 1008w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jihan Abass, CEO, Lami<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that having more female investors, more female IC members, board members will eventually lead to more investments in female-led businesses. My lead investor Accion has lots of female-led startups in their portfolio and I do believe that this is driven by the team they have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Most VC firms are required to deliver returns on their investments.

I saw many of these challenges growing up, so I have a deeper understanding of how society operates and how people view things. This perspective provides an edge when building solutions for the continent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our achievements have been consistent and making sure the VCs can see this growth we have made so far builds on trust and understanding of the potential growth Lami contains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fundamentally believe that it is impossible for investors to expect big returns from businesses they never funded. If female-led companies were given the same levels of investments, I do believe we\u2019d have more unicorns not just in Africa but worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The power of one\u2019s network cannot be overemphasized in the business world. How were you able to utilize yours when it came to securing funding?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My network in the tech space was quite limited. But I had a few great friends who introduced me to investors in their network. Our lead investor contacted us after hearing me speak on a panel at a virtual event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>In the VC space, it is said that those who hold the money tend to invest more in people who look like them. That\u2019s why women founders are encouraged to transition into angel or VC investing to increase the number of women-led startups that get investments. Do you see yourself making this transition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what I can accomplish at this level as a founder is to hire more women within our organization to encourage participation in such a field. For example, hiring top female talent because I think ultimately, you\u2019re empowering them to see that it\u2019s not impossible to build a fintech business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, they may potentially be able to go and start their own business. Being able to set up that kind of culture, hiring more women and empowering them could be an easier way to impact the transition of more women in fintech. I hope that one day I\u2019ll be on the other side of the table and provide support as an investor because I do believe that is the best way to transform the landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8eNgCIsMDN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa\/\">Kenya&#8217;s Lami raises $1.8M to scale API insurance platform across Africa<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kenya&#8217;s Lami raises $1.8M to scale API insurance platform across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa\/embed\/#?secret=noDvbI5o1W#?secret=8eNgCIsMDN\" data-secret=\"8eNgCIsMDN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Honey Ogundeyi, CEO, Edukoya<\/h2>\n<p><b>Please tell us what your company does.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/edukoya.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edukoya <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is an education technology company on a mission to make high-quality education more engaging, personalized, and accessible for the next generation of Africans.

regulator, the Competition Commission, found as uncompetitive its intention to block the government\u2019s startup GovChat and #LetsTalk from using its WhatsApp Business API.<\/p>\n<p>The watchdog, which has been investigating claims of unfair conduct against the startup since March 2021, referred Meta (formerly Facebook) for prosecution to the Competition Tribunal, which adjudicates complaints of restrictive practices and abuse of dominance.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.compcom.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/FACEBOOK-PROSECUTED-FOR-ABUSING-ITS-DOMINANCE.pdf\">In its referral<\/a>, the regulator recommends that Meta is made to pay the &#8220;maximum penalty&#8221; \u2013 a fine of 10% of the US company\u2019s local turnover.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284479\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The commission alleges that Meta threatened to block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.govchat.org\/about\/\">GovChat<\/a> and #LetsTalk from using its WhatsApp Business API \u201cin or about\u201d July 2020. It adds that Meta imposed unfair restrictions on data usage by the startup, limiting its ability to innovate and develop new products and services that could potentially compete with Meta\u2019s products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the terms and conditions governing access to WhatsApp Business API are designed to shield and insulate Facebook from potential competition, such as the potential competition presented by GovChat and enormous data it has been able to harvest which enables it to develop new services and products,\u201d said the regulator in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>GovChat was launched in 2018 by the South African government as a citizen engagement platform that uses the WhatsApp Business API to facilitate real-time communication. It now has 8.7 million active users and has processed over 582 million messages, as per government data.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the platform being a source of alerts and complaints on civic issues &#8212; like potholes on roads &#8212; GovChat has been used by the government to process social security applications, including for distress support during the Covid pandemic. Over 13.3 million applications have been submitted through the GovChat platform.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The referral for prosecution comes days after competition supervisory bodies from five African countries, including South Africa, signed a memorandum of understanding that would, among other agenda, foster collaborative action against the obstacles that limit the emergence and expansion of African digital platforms. The other parties to the agreement were Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius and Nigeria.<\/p>\n<p>Meta in a statement sent to TechCrunch said that &#8220;WhatsApp will defend its right to take all reasonable steps to protect its proprietary WhatsApp Business API and the interests of users across the world&#8221; while stating that GovChat was a private business that had breached set terms by &#8220;signing up organizations to the WhatsApp API without going through our on-boarding process. This is required for all organizations who wish to use our service and means we know who is using our services and that organizations agree to our privacy practices.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>WhatsApp spokesperson in South Africa said, \u201cWhatsApp helps to provide people with important information from trusted sources, and we are aware of the role the service plays in connecting South African citizens with their Government. That\u2019s why we want to work with GovChat in compliance with internationally recognized regulatory standards to provide this service.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;However, GovChat has repeatedly refused to comply with our policies which are designed to protect citizens and their information, preferring to prioritise its own commercial interests over the public. We will continue to defend WhatsApp from abuse and protect our users,\u201d said the spokesperson.<\/p>\n<p>Globally, Meta has been subjected to various kinds of scrutiny for possible anticompetitive behavior. Just last week, the European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether an agreement between Meta and Google, code-name \u201cJedi-Blue\u201d, for online display advertising services may have breached EU competition rules.<\/p>\n<p>The September 2018 Jedi-Blue agreement sought the participation of Meta&#8217;s Audience Network in Google&#8217;s Open Bidding programme, a move that could potentially exclude other ad tech service providers to \u201cdistort competition in markets for online display advertising, to the detriment of publishers, and ultimately consumers,\u201d noted the European Commission.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission is suing Meta for illegal monopolization, alleging that the social media giant is illegally maintaining its social networking monopoly through anticompetitive actions, including the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp nearly one decade ago.<\/p>\n<p><em>The story has been updated to include Meta&#8217;s response.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meta is facing prosecution in South Africa, after the country\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition Commission, found as uncompetitive its intention to block the government\u2019s startup GovChat and #LetsTalk from using its WhatsApp Business API.

Firm founder Kirsten Green, who was earlier an equity research analyst at Banc of America Securities, was maybe more aware than most that this picture was about to dramatically change; over the years, Forerunner invested in a company that delivered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/20\/business\/dealbook\/unilever-dollar-shave-club.html\">cheap razors<\/a> to people&#8217;s doorsteps, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessoffashion.com\/videos\/beauty\/video-whats-next-for-glossier\/\">beauty company<\/a> built atop a devoted community, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/08\/curated-wants-to-be-the-expert-in-your-pocket-when-making-that-next-big-purchase\/\">marketplace<\/a> that matches bewildered shoppers with people who are \u201cexpert\u201d in their fields.<\/p>\n<p>Forerunner&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/15\/airbnb-officially-owns-hoteltonight\/\">bets<\/a> have been so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wal-mart-to-acquire-jet-com-for-3-3-billion-in-cash-stock-1470659763\">prescient<\/a> in some <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/16\/walmart-to-buy-bonobos-for-310m-in-its-bigger-push-into-fashion-retail\/\">cases<\/a> that the young outfit is now managing roughly $2 billion in assets after quietly closing its sixth fund with a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forerunnerventures.com\/our-perspectives\/the-future-forerunners\">$1 billion<\/a> in capital commitments last month.<\/p>\n<p>Given the team&#8217;s success in funding what&#8217;s up and coming, we talked with Green last week for a podcast interview about the trends Forerunner is tracking closely right now. Some of what we discussed follows, edited for length and clarity. You can also listen to that chat in its entirety <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/kirsten-green-on-the-rise-of-solopreneurs\/id1498270180?i=1000553778988\">here<\/a>.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283270\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>TC: In recent years, per a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forerunnerventures.com\/our-perspectives\/the-future-forerunners\">post<\/a> you authored recently, Forerunner has become more focused on this trend of creators on Instagram and Substack and other platforms who are reaching audiences directly. Where do you think we are in terms of that trend?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KG: A lot of that thinking, if not most of it, still feels very relevant and active for us today. Thinking about powering the one-to-one opportunity and what it takes to make that viable is multilayered. You start with this idea that anyone who&#8217;s got something to say can now be a publisher and put [out content] and charge for it. But the difference between that idea and its execution is a lot, because it&#8217;s a lot to do and it&#8217;s hard to do. So we try thinking: what are the tools and services and software and community that needs to support the person who is becoming the single entrepreneur, the &#8216;solopreneur&#8217;? There&#8217;s a whole ecosystem of efforts that need to be built and trialed and tested and moved forward. I think we&#8217;re still early on in the innings of organizing all of that and [producing] the really big, breakout companies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A number of live-streaming commerce companies have raised significant funding over the last year to sell a wide variety of items. You&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/loupe-tech-lands-12m-series-a-to-connect-sports-card-enthusiasts\/\">bet on one<\/a>, Loupe Tech, a live e-commerce streaming platform built for sports card collectors. Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to discretionary spending, sometimes it&#8217;s about the item, but a lot of times it&#8217;s about the journey. We had malls that brought lots of stores together to create a dynamic environment .\u00a0 .\u00a0 You [separately see] people on social networks\u00a0 following people and engaging in content. It&#8217;s sort of natural kind to think, okay, there&#8217;s a shopping component somewhere in here, too. It&#8217;s part of the mix of the entertainment and the engagement and the camaraderie that happens. And certainly we&#8217;ve seen this in other places in the world, most predominantly in China, where [live-streamed shopping] it&#8217;s a huge business.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>[Layer into the mix other] this collectibles trend, which is also not new, and the sports memorabilia market [which is] a huge, significant market [the majority of which is still offline] and the founder of Loupe, Eric [Doty]. He comes from Xbox. He has a lot of experience around gamification and game-oriented experiences. He is passionate about the category and really articulated a vision for how to create a great intersection of entertainment and exchange &#8212; which is commerce in this case &#8212; and maybe even be a third screen for people who are engaging in watching sports or sports activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you giving much thought these days to the so-called metaverse? Do brands need a metaverse strategy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The whole metaverse, web3, crypto [universe] of opportunity or conversation is really interesting and really promising. Like most new things, it&#8217;s unknown how long it takes to play out or when the mass adoption [reaches] a tipping point. But I definitely believe in it, and I think most companies do [because of the] contributing trends driving it, so with that in mind, I think it&#8217;s, &#8216;Get in there and start experimenting. Get comfortable. Start building muscle in it. Think about what&#8217;s right for your business and brand and identify where there are opportunities, [be it for] customer acquisition or customer retention or even to sell new things, because quite frankly, all of those things are probably in play in that universe. It&#8217;s not going to come out of the gate as a make-or-break-it [moment] for anyone&#8217;s business in 2022. But a few years out, or maybe even closer, it could.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What, if any, related bets have you made on web3-type companies?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve invested in a handful of B2B companies over the last 18 months because of the stage of development of that whole ecosystem. A bunch of them have not been announced. But we think with this web3 evolution, companies can use it to have a future-leading stance on community, on empowerment, maybe even a future product strategy.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m imagining a whole new protocol being developed for digital connections. On the infrastructure side, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of opportunity, and that&#8217;s not historically where Forerunner has really showed up. We&#8217;ve been more on the front line as it relates to the consumer. So I think [our focus is on] what is it going to take to include web2 companies in web3. [To date, much of the activity has] lived in specific corners of the universe [including] NFTs, which, when they hit the radar, may have confused people [regarding] how they worked or why [consumers] should value them. But\u00a0 the idea that there was a good or a service that you could pay money for [by using NFTs] resonated . . . [Now] to make [them] more mainstream, I\u00a0 imagine there needs to be real use cases &#8212;\u00a0 something beyond a novelty &#8212; and there needs to be much lower friction in how you engage. So the effort to make that happen is essential to getting [web3] mainstream and ubiquitous and valuable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities [in creating] that bridge.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Forerunner Ventures was founded in 2012, traditional brands still reigned supreme, and most of us shopped in physical spaces.

startup&#8217;s initial public offering.<\/p>\n<p>The round was led by Singapore based Amansa Capital, Kotak PE and Axis Growth Avenues AIF &#8211; I. A number of existing investors as well as new set of angel investors including Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, BoAt\u2019s Aman Gupta and Haresh Chawla of True North also participated in the new round.<\/p>\n<p>The new funding &#8212; which is an extension to the $52 million Series F disclosed last year &#8212; brings Licious&#8217; all-time raise to $488 million, according to insight platform Tracxn.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284465\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Licious, which counts Temasek, 3One4 Capital and IIFL among its backers, operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in over a dozen Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh and deliver within hours of the order.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s among a group of growing startups that is disrupting the meat and seafood category, an area that has largely been unorganized and underserved. Analysts at Bernstein estimate that the meat and seafood market is a $40 billion opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Captain Fresh, which operates a business-to-business marketplace, earlier this month <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/06\/captain-fresh-fish-seafood\/\">announced a $50 million fundraise<\/a> that more than doubled the startup&#8217;s valuation in just three months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, Licious is the highest valued D2C start-up in India. This valuation is a direct outcome of the value that we have created for our stakeholders- investments made towards building the category have borne us rich dividends and have propelled growth for the company and its people,&#8221; said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura, co-founders of Licious, in a joint statement.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The growing interest of investors- from India and abroad alike is an added assurance that obsession with customers, quality and service standards are the pillars of the best businesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The startup did not disclose any metrics today, but it has been a beneficiary of the surge in direct-to-consumer brands&#8217; popularity amid the pandemic. In October, it said its business had grown by over 500% year-on-year.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284473\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284473\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2284473 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg?resize=768,380 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg?resize=680,336 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/india-d2c-brands-covid.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sharp scale up in operations of digital brands in FY21, partly pushed by COVID.

Existing backers including Indus Valley Capital, Defy Partners, Acrew Capital, Wavemaker Partners, B&amp;Y Venture Partners and Zayn Capital also participated in the new round, which brings one-and-a-half year old startup\u2019s all-time raise to over $100 million.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bazaar-tech.com\">Bazaar<\/a> is attempting to build what it calls an \u201coperating system for traditional retail\u201d in Pakistan. It\u2019s a $170 billion market that comprises 5 million small, medium-sized and enterprises across the country.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284452\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>But these merchants are largely unbanked and offline today. Banks and other formal financial institutions don\u2019t extend credit to these merchants because they don\u2019t have a credit score. This gap has forced many of these shop operators to take loans from shark loan providers.<\/p>\n<p>For those following the South Asia coverage, this challenge will sound very familiar.<\/p>\n<p>Business-to-business e-commerce Udaan, logistics startup ElasticRun, and Dukaan, a startup that is helping shops go online, as well as scores of startups and giants including Reliance and Amazon are solving a similar problem in India.<\/p>\n<p>Bazaar is combining many of these offerings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The startup\u2019s B2B e-commerce marketplace, thanks to its network of a dozen fulfillment facilities, is helping merchants in 21 towns and cities across Pakistan procure items to sell.<\/p>\n<p>These merchants also use the startup\u2019s Easy Khata app, which helps them maintain bookkeeping. Bazaar&#8217;s financial arm, called Bazaar Credit, is offering these merchants, many of whom operate neighborhood stores, with short-term working capital financing.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284456\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284456\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2284456 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg 1759w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bazaar-services-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bazaar&#8217;s suite of commerce, fintech and supply chain products<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Piecing together many of its services makes sense for a startup like Bazaar in Pakistan as it enables the startup to offer a more comprehensive set of values to a merchant and Easy Khata is helping the firm win customers, said Saad Jangda, co-founder of Bazaar, in an interview with TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>In August, \u201cwe had just started piloting our credit product and at the time we had partnered with a third-party,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cNow, our credit product is developed completely in-house and is digitally-enabled that connects to our last mile network. Everything from order generation to credit disbursement to cash collection is done completely by Bazaar,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe acquire customers through Easy Khata, funnel them through commerce, and once we have enough data on the merchants, we start building a credit product atop of it,\u201d he said, adding that the startup has issued thousands of loans in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Easy Khata has amassed over 2.4 million registered businesses across 500 cities in Pakistan. \u201cBut more importantly, Easy Khata is serving as both a core system of records and also helping us launch in new cities,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Merchants have recorded over $10 billion in annualized bookkeeping transaction value on Easy Khata, the startup said. \u201cOur expansion within Pakistan in the last few months is a testament to how crucial Easy Khata is for us,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The startup\u2019s last mile network, which was operational in just two cities in August of last year, is now adding three to four cities each month.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe goal is to keep building for Pakistan. We want to cover more than 100 urban and rural centres across the country and build the largest network in the country so that we can move any category of goods from point A to B whenever and wherever is needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to more cities across Pakistan and launch new marketplace categories. It is also working to scale its lending offerings and explore new product lines.<\/p>\n<p>Childhood friends Saad and Hamza reconnected in Dubai a few years ago. At the time, Jawaid was at McKinsey &amp; Company while Jangda was working with Careem as a product manager for ride-hailing and food delivery products. The opportunities they saw in their home nation drove them back to the country to build Bazaar.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to support Bazaar\u2019s vision of building an end-to-end commerce and fintech platform for millions of unbanked and offline merchants in Pakistan,\u201d said Christian Jensen, Partner at Dragoneer Investment Group. \u201cBazaar\u2019s pace of geographic expansion and new product development is a testament to the rare talent and culture Hamza and Saad have cultivated at Bazaar.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dragoneer Investment Group and Tiger Global are backing Bazaar, a startup that is attempting to digitize Pakistan\u2019s retail with e-commerce, fintech and last-mile supply chain solutions, they said today, joining a growing list of high-profile investors making large bets in the South Asian market.

plans to offer electric bikes in Paris. Instead of buying those bikes, Motto customers will be able to rent them for a fixed price of \u20ac75 per month (around $82 at today\u2019s exchange rate).<\/p>\n<p>Customers get Motto-branded electric bikes with a motor in the rear wheel that helps you pedal up to a speed of 25km\/h. It has integrated lights, a GPS tracker and an anti-theft system. It features a carbon belt and the battery is removable.<\/p>\n<p>The battery is integrated in the seat tube, meaning that you can access the battery by removing the saddle and taking it with you. There are two different models, a step-over model and a low-step model. The frame is slightly different but everything else is identical.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283992\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>But Motto doesn\u2019t want to stop at hardware. Users aren\u2019t just renting a bike, they\u2019re subscribing to a service. The monthly subscription fee includes damage and theft insurance, as well as on-demand maintenance and repairs.<\/p>\n<p>When there\u2019s something wrong with your Motto bike, you can open the app and request a repair within 48 hours. In the near future, Motto plans to offer a baby carrier and a front rack as subscription add-ons.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2283997\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2283997\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2283997\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg 3986w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=300,187 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1279 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2283997\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Motto<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The startup has raised a $4.4 million seed round led by Cassius Family and Founders Future (\u20ac4 million). Several business angels are also participating. Before rebranding to Motto, the startup was originally called Bloom \u2014 200 users tested the service in Paris already.<\/p>\n<p>And everybody will be able to sign up and get a bike starting in April 2022. The startup will compete with other bike subscription services, such as German startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/e-bike-subscription-service-dance-adds-new-cities-and-mopeds\/\">Dance<\/a>, Netherlands company <a href=\"https:\/\/swapfiets.com\">Swapfiets<\/a> and publicly-funded service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veligo-location.fr\">V\u00e9ligo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, the startup competes with public transportation, bike-sharing schemes and buying your own electric bike. The bike-as-a-service model provides many advantages.<\/p>\n<p>First, you don\u2019t have to pay a large sum of money upfront. Second, many bike owners don\u2019t want to get an electric bike because of thefts. Third, many people want to make sure they can actually use a bike to commute before buying one.<\/p>\n<p>For all these reasons, it\u2019s good to see that bike-as-a-service represents another interesting option to get started with bikes. I still believe that we\u2019re at the very start of the urban mobility revolution and people will end up using different transportation methods to get from point A to point B \u2014 especially in European cities.

Cloud gets more expensive"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Renting cloud infrastructure typically gets cheaper over time, but Google Cloud is bucking this trend today with <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/infrastructure\/updates-to-google-clouds-infrastructure-pricing\">significant price increases<\/a> across a number of core services. These increases, which Google announced under the guise of wanting to provide &#8220;more flexible pricing models and options,&#8221; will go into effect on October 1, 2022. Most developers are <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=30671997\">not amused<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all bad news, with some archive storage at rest in Google&#8217;s U.S., Europe and Asia regions decreasing in price and there&#8217;s a new lower-cost Persistent Disk archive snapshot option, too. The company is also raising its &#8220;Always Free Internet&#8221; egress from 1GB per month to 100GB per month.<\/p>\n<p>But a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/storage\/pricing-announce\">core storage features<\/a>, like multi-region <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/storage\/docs\/storage-classes\">Nearline<\/a> storage, will see increases of 50 percent. Operations pricing for Google Cloud&#8217;s Coldline Storage Class A will double from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.20. And while reading data in a Cloud Storage bucket located in a multi-region from a service in a region on the same continent was previously free, it&#8217;ll now be priced just like any other data movement between Google Cloud locations on the same continent.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284438\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Load balancing, too, will see a price increase now that Google applies an &#8220;outbound data processing charge&#8221; of $0.008 to $0.012 depending on the region. Ticketmaster would be proud, but Google says this will align its pricing with other leading cloud providers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Google Cloud offers innovative solutions to transform businesses, priced in a customer-focused and consistent way. With our pay-as-you-go pricing structure, customers have the ability to better match costs to the services they use. Customers can also more easily compare services between leading cloud providers,&#8221; the company writes in an FAQ today.<\/p>\n<p>The marketing teams of the other leading cloud providers are probably having a field day with this announcement, but moving large amounts of data is hard. There&#8217;s a reason people talk about data gravity. That&#8217;s one area where you can maybe raise prices without having to fear an exodus of customers.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the flowery language in the announcement, Google is clearly aware of the impact these changes will have. Why else would its FAQ note that its customers should &#8220;adapt their current usage to better align their applications to these new business models and help mitigate some of the price changes,&#8221; after all?<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google &#8212; and Google Cloud especially &#8212; already suffers from the perception that it will <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=30675506\">shut down services<\/a> almost randomly, even though its customers depend on them. Now add to that the perception that it will randomly hike its prices and its sales teams will likely have to work overtime to fulfill the ambitious growth goals the company has surely set for itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Renting cloud infrastructure typically gets cheaper over time, but Google Cloud is bucking this trend today with significant price increases across a number of core services.

Liquidity Providers, anywhere in the world, use Sommelier to author and execute complex, automated financial transactions, such as portfolio rebalancing, limit orders, automated yield farming as well as a host of other features that token holders demand to access in the new financial era of decentralized exchanges. Sommelier was founded in 2020 by Zaki Manian, a lead developer on the Cosmos protocol and Tendermint, and a prolific team of Ethereum and Cosmos developers. Sommelier is actively seeking new contributors and community members.","button_caption":"LEARN MORE","button_link":"https:\/\/sommelier.finance\/","button_link_open_new_window":1,"uid":"2ca44d4c-4884-48cc-8992-7e6beed36498","panels_info":{"class":"TC\\Page_Builder\\Events\\Full_Width_Image_Block","raw":false,"grid":0,"cell":0,"id":6,"style":{"background_image_attachment":2248418,"background_display":"tile","font_color":"#ffffff"}},"type":"full-width-image","backgroundImageURL":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Event_Background-1.jpg"},{"text":"<p>Email <a href=\"mailto:events@techcrunch.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">events@techcrunch.com<\/a> will your questions and one of our representatives will assist you.<\/p>","title":"Need Help?","type":"text","uid":"8020e842-66be-4fcf-b525-c0d75041144f","panels_info":{"class":"TC\\Page_Builder\\TinyMCE\\Widget","raw":false,"grid":0,"cell":0,"id":7,"style":{"background_image_attachment":false,"background_display":"tile"}},"backgroundImageURL":null}],"blockMetadata":{"agenda":{"title":"Agenda"},"speakers":{"title":"Speakers"},"sponsors":{"title":"Partners"},"newsletter":{"title":"","content":""},"video":{"title":""}},"blockNavigation":null,"videoCarouselPlaylistID":"","livestreams":false,"promotionReelHash":"","eventStatus":"pre","exhibitorData":[],"marketingOffers":{"countdown":{"display":false},"ctaBlock":{"display":false}},"marketoID":"","navigation":{"blocks":[{"text":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2248538\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Logo-Mock-Up.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"133\" \/><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2220354\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","title":"Virtual Event Presented By","type":"text","uid":"c8f5ccbd-344b-4353-8d0a-d1dafab21a93","panels_info":{"class":"TC\\Page_Builder\\TinyMCE\\Widget","raw":false,"grid":0,"cell":0,"id":0,"style":{"background_image_attachment":false,"background_display":"tile","font_color":"#ffffff"}},"backgroundImageURL":null,"nav_title":"","display":false},{"title":"DeFi & The Future of Programmable Money","description":"Sommelier Finance partners with TechCrunch to bring decentralized exchanges, liquidity providers, stablecoins, degens and regulators together to provide a glimpse into the fast approaching future of finance.
