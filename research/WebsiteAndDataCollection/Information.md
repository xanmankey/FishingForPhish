# PhishAI: An AI phishing-website detection bot!
A pivotal part of the research process is future considerations. Seeing as the success of a machine learning model is proportional to the amount of accurate, preprocessed data it is trained on, a website that can be used to collect more data, as well as abstract the model and allow for easier testing and understanding is useful for future research regarding phishing detection. The data can be found in the link to the PhishAI GitHub in the same directory. The server side code has not been committed for security purposes, but if you wish to analyze or contribute to it, you can reach out to me at Xander.Kutulas@gmail.com.
