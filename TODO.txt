GOALS
Completely refactor code (scipy, or maybe tensorflow. Move away from java development) with a focus on optimization (numpy, pandas?),
readability, and ease of use. Basically, the goal is to simplify it by building it off of the simpler scikit-learn API.
Add testing

COMPLETED
Made notes about classes (and some individual functions) for what needs to be, could be, or should be refactored

TODO
Look into scikit-learn functionality (to see if refactoring is feasible) based on comments
Attempt to refactor the SaveFish class
If it works, adapt the StartFish class accordingly
Look into general optimizations (especially with my non-optimizer classes; those are the heart of the library)

CLASSIFICATION + REGRESSION
I'm pigeon-holing a lot of the settings; I want to incorporate my API with scikit-learns to allow for as MUCH dynamism as possible.

It seems like all of this is possible with scikit-learn; now I want to figure out a better way to handle Selenium errors
I think perhaps instead of handling Selenium errors, what if I only accepted websites w/ ACTIVE return values?
(an active return value is defined here: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database)
